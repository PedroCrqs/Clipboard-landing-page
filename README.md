## My process

### ðŸ”§ Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- Pure **CSS3** styling
- Responsive layout using **Flexbox**
- Responsive design with **Media Queries**
- **Mobile-first** development workflow
- Inline **SVG icons** styled via `currentColor`
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages**
- Version controlled with **Git and GitHub**

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I significantly deepened my understanding of front-end development fundamentals. Here are the key skills and concepts I strengthened:

- How to structure a semantic and accessible layout using **HTML5**
- How to build fully responsive websites with **CSS3**, focusing on **desktop-first** principles
- Mastery of **Flexbox** for horizontal and vertical alignment, spacing, and reordering content across devices
- How to apply **media queries** to adapt layout and typography across screen sizes
- Best practices for managing **spacing**, **overflow**, and **content alignment** to avoid layout issues
- How to incorporate **inline SVG icons** and style them dynamically with `fill="currentColor"`
- Clean code structuring for scalability and maintainability
- Using **Git** and **GitHub** for project versioning and deployment via **GitHub Pages**

This challenge helped me bridge the gap between static design and responsive, production-ready HTML/CSS code.
